 * For example, if your niece is turning 4 years old, and the cake will have 4 candles of height 4, 4, 1, 3, she will be able to blow out 2 candles successfully, since the tallest candles are of height 4 and there are 2 such candles.
 *
 *
 * We have one candle of height 1, one candle of height 2, and two candles of height 3. Your niece only blows out the tallest candles, meaning the candles where height = 3  Because there are 2 such candles, we print 2 on a new line.
